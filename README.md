JavaScript is pretty amazing. JavaScript app will allow us to add tasks, to edit them, mark them as complete, and delete them. All this happens with the help of CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and the browserâ€™s local storage.

2. Press the "Enter" key or click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list.
3. Click on a task to mark it as completed.
4. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
